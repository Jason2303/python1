These are a collection of projects I worked on utilizing my knowledge in Python and networking

Projects include:
- **Caesar Cipher**: Simple script for encrypting and decrypting text using Caesar cipher.
- **Password Manager**: Utilizing tkinter for a GUI that takes in emails and provides a hashed password for the user.
- **Traffic Analyzer**: Analyzes network traffic logs for suspicious patterns.
- **Vuln Hunt**: Automates the process of scanning for known software vulnerabilities.
